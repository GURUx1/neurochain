Brainwave-powered coin mining prototype
# NeuroChain 🧠

Welcome to **NeuroChain** — the world's first experimental brainwave-powered blockchain concept built entirely with free tools and open-source spirit.

## 🚀 Concept
NeuroChain simulates mining using human focus tasks instead of computational power. Each “proof of focus” task generates a simulated NeuroCoin (NRC) entry stored on the blockchain ledger.

## ⚙️ Components
- **miner.py** → runs focus challenges and logs blocks  
- **ledger.json** → stores mined NeuroCoins locally  
- **server.py** → (coming soon) connects all miners to a shared ledger online  

## 🧩 Vision
To create a decentralized network where human attention becomes a measurable, valuable resource — a new kind of crypto built by people, for people.
